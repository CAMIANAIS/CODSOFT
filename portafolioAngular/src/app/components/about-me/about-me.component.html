    <p>
      I am from Per√∫! I am self-taught with a quick learning ability and an agile
      approach to project execution. I have strong web programming
      skills, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, and React.
      Additionally, I excel in developing applications in Java and C#,
      and in database management, especially with MySQL Server. My
      experience in entrepreneurship, startups, and social innovation
      ecosystems has enriched my perspective and prepared me to
      face diverse challenges.
